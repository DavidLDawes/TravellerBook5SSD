# Traveller Book 5 Starship Designer
This is an attempt to buiold a ship design tool that faithfully(-ish) implements the Traveller SRD version of starship design.

This is based on my Starship designer, which I did mostly to learn Go UI programming.

See the LICENSE for the usual MIT license for my code (basically do what you want, it's OK by me, as long as you copy the MIT license) as well as the OPEN GAME LICENSE for the Traveller SRD concepts this is built on.
