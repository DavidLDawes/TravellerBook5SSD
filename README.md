# Traveller SRD Capital Ship Starship Designer
This is an attempt to build a starship design tool that faithfully(-ish) implements [the Traveller SRD capital ship starship design|https://www.traveller-srd.com/high-guard/capital-ship-design/].

This is based on my Starship designer, which I did mostly to learn Go UI programming.

See the OpenGameLicense for the details on how things are licensed, this is just more of that.
